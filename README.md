*** Objective of the Simulator ***
The Solar ROI (Return on Investment) Simulator aims to estimate the potential financial return of investing in a solar photovoltaic (PV) system. This tool will help users evaluate the costs and benefits of installing solar energy systems based on parameters such as system size, installation cost, energy savings, and other variables.


*** Technology to Use for LAMP Stack ***
The LAMP Stack technology used for this project consists of the following components:

Linux (Operating System) or Windows
Apache (Web server)
MySQL (Database management system)
PHP (Programming language for processing data)
This stack will provide the necessary infrastructure to host and manage the Solar ROI Simulator, process calculations, and store user inputs.

*** Project Structure ***
index.php - Main entry point and user interface of the simulator.
calculate.php - PHP script that processes user input and performs ROI calculations.
styles.css - CSS file for styling the user interface.
scripts.js - Optional JavaScript for additional interactivity or validation.
database - (If required) MySQL database for storing user data or past calculations.

*** Main Functionalities ***
Input Form: Users will input parameters like system size (in kW), installation cost, energy savings, and other relevant variables.
Calculation Logic: The PHP script will calculate the ROI based on user input.
Result Display: After the calculation, the results will be displayed to the user, showing ROI, payback period, and energy savings over time.
Responsive Design: The UI should adjust properly to different screen sizes for accessibility.

*** Steps to Display Results on a Local XAMPP Server or Real Web Server: ***
1. Set Up XAMPP (Local Server)
Install XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL.
Place your project in the htdocs folder of XAMPP.
Access the project in the browser using http://localhost/your-project-folder.

3. Upload to a Real Web Server
Choose a Hosting Provider that supports PHP and MySQL.
Upload your project files to the server using FTP or cPanel File Manager.
Ensure that the database (if needed) is correctly set up on the hosting server.
Access your project via your domain name.
